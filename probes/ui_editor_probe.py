"""DS3 probe: the studio's UE5 face is real and in sync — ui/index.html
carries every panel (menubar, Place Actors, Outliner, Details, Content
Browser, Output Log, status bar, PIE bar), lists every scene on the wire
(scenes/*.dxn1.json — the SCENES array and the directory agree), wears
every image it references (assets/*.png, PNG magic verified), pins its
embedded VERSION to the repo's VERSION file (the fifth corner of the
version sync), and ships with no TODO lint. R46 adds the translate-gizmo
law and the panel laws (context menu, World Settings, content search,
